- Inside `Hardware-Assignment`, follow this structure:
  - `codes/`  
    - `arduino/` â†’ Arduino code files (.ino or or assembly or .c and all those hex files if any)  
    - `linear_regression/` â†’ Code related to linear regression or analysis (.py, etc.)
  - `figs/` â†’ Circuit diagrams, block diagrams, or other figures  
  - `tables/` â†’ Data tables, experiment results, etc.

## ðŸ§¾ Submission Guidelines

1. **Folder Naming:** Use both team membersâ€™ roll numbers, joined by an underscore (e.g., `ee24btech110xx_ee25btech110yy`).

3. **Pull Request Submission:**  
   - Only **one team member** should submit a pull request (PR).

     Example:  
     ```
     Commit message: ee25btech110yy ee25btech110xx - EE1030 Hardware Project Submission
     ```
   - Do **not** send multiple pull requests from the same team.  
4. **Late Submissions:** Will be penalized as per course policy.
